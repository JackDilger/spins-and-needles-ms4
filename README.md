## Strategy and planning

Why Spins & Needles?

This project was born out of my passion for music and when creating an e-commerce store, I wanted to be able to sell products I was personally invested in but would also be a viable revenue stream in a very crowded online market. 

As streaming platforms gradually took offer the market, physical music copies seem to be dying out, but Vinyl has seen a strong resurgence in recent years. Today, about 85% of main stream music’s sales are vinyl and Last year saw U.S. revenues exceed $1 billion for the first time since the mid-80s. Ever growing interest from younger people has helped drive this, compared to the average buyer of music, buyers of vinyl records are 57% more likely to be aged under 25. Buyers clearly still appreciate the bonus of physical ownership in a world of streaming music. 

Taking all this information in to account I believe targeting the Vinyl market will help us succeed in our main aim of creating a viable revenue stream. Also, with such a large portion of sales coming from the younger age bracket I think that would offer good longevity, as we can maintain a loyal customer base who can grow with the company. 

Sales are important but we also aim to build a community of likeminded music lovers who can interact with each other. The events page was a big part of this, offering customers a chance to meet each other and enjoy local and international talent. Adding the comments section will encourage customers to interact and help build that community feel. 

One of our main aims throughout was to ensure all customer information was kept secure, and users can have peace of mind when handling payments safely with us. We understand the importance of safely managing data online, which is why we used several defensive programming features in the app to ensure this was done correctly.
